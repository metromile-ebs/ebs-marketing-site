        >As AI becomes more deeply integrated in the industry, carriers must
        position themselves to respond to the changing business landscape.
        Insurance executives must understand the factors that will contribute to
        this change and how AI will reshape claims, distribution, and
        underwriting and pricing. With this understanding, they can start to
        build the skills and talent, embrace the emerging technologies, and
        create the culture and perspective needed to be successful players in
        the insurance industry of the future.</q
