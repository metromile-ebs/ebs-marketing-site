      <q>...insurers are advised to look beyond mere cost savings and seek a richer, more data-driven and
        analytics-enabled
        customer experience that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced technologies. Insurers
        that get it
        right will transform claims from a necessary back-office function into a source of competitive advantage, market
        differentiation and increased customer loyalty.</q>
