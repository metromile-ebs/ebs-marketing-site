        >In the short time it has been around in the insurance industry, AI has
        increased efficiency and decreased labor costs in insurance claims
        processing. Ultimately, any measure taken by an insurer has to have one
        end goalâ€”attract new customers and retain existing customers by
        delighting them with world-class service across all customer
        touchpoints. AI-infused claims processing is enabling insurers to
        achieve this goal.</q
