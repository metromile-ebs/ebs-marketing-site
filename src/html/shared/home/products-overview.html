          bodyOG="The key to success with AI begins with FNOL. The First Notice of
          Loss is an insurer’s biggest opportunity to impress, thereby
          building trust and loyalty; or to disappoint, leading them to tell
          the world about their negative experience. FNOL is also an
          opportunity to capture rich structured information directly from
          the customer. This reduces downstream processing costs, supplies
          our AI more data to identify fraud early, and streamline
          downstream claims processing activity. Metromile’s DFNOL provides
          a streamlined, delightful experience that experience-conscious
          consumers demand. The result is happier customers, fewer phone
          calls, and a flood of rich data to help make your claims
          organization even more efficient.",

          body="You can't achieve AI success without rich, reliable data — which
          begins with the First Notice of Loss. This is also your biggest opportunity
          to make a positive impression on your customer, which is why we built
          AVA Dynamic FNOL. It offers a clean, delightful experience for your
          customers while providing a rich tapestry of data for AVA Fraud
          Intelligence and efficient downstream processing.",

          sophisticated AI-powered fraud detection.",

          bodyOG="As criminals become more sophisticated, only AI has the ability to
              scan every incoming claim in less than a second to reduce your
              loss leakage while keeping you up to date on the latest trends.
              However, AI can’t do this job alone. Our approach encapsulates the
              deep expertise of your investigators into signals that our AI
              power tools take advantage of, leading to happier investigators
              and reduced loss ratio. Use as a standalone product, or pair with
              DFNOL to hamper criminals at the point of loss.",

          body="AVA Fraud Intelligence is a sophisticated model trained over years
          on hundreds of thousands of claims, and works best in partnership with
          your expert SIUs. Scan every incoming claim in less
          than a second and surface suspicious claims to your investigators so they
          can do what they do best — no more filtering through long queues of false
          positives. AVA Fraud Intelligence works great on its own, but pair it
          with AVA dFNOL to unlock even bigger reductions in loss leakage.",
