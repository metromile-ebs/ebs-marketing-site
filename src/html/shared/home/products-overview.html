              Delight your customers with the highest rated digital FNOL

              processing.

            <p>
              The key to success with AI begins with FNOL. The First Notice of
              Loss is an insurer’s biggest opportunity to impress, thereby
              building trust and loyalty; or to disappoint, leading them to tell
              the world about their negative experience. FNOL is also an
              opportunity to capture rich structured information directly from
              the customer. This reduces downstream processing costs, supplies
              our AI more data to identify fraud early, and streamline
              downstream claims processing activity. Metromile’s DFNOL provides
              a streamlined, delightful experience that experience-conscious
              consumers demand. The result is happier customers, fewer phone
              calls, and a flood of rich data to help make your claims
              organization even more efficient.

              As criminals become more sophisticated, only AI has the ability to
              scan every incoming claim in less than a second to reduce your
              loss leakage while keeping you up to date on the latest trends.
              However, AI can’t do this job alone. Our approach encapsulates the
              deep expertise of your investigators into signals that our AI
              power tools take advantage of, leading to happier investigators
              and reduced loss ratio. Use as a standalone product, or pair with
              DFNOL to hamper criminals at the point of loss.

              The real magic of AI is realized with our Claims Automation
              Engine. More than simple RPA, this tool takes on the high volume
              of easy, mundane, and repetitive tasks inherent in claims
              processing. Not only will you reduce LAE, cycle times, and human
              error, but your claims adjusters will love you. Gone are the days
              where they must robotically spend most of their time on mundane
              tasks. Now, they can focus on higher touch customer service for
              challenging claims.
