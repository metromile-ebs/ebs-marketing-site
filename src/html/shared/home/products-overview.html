          bodyOG="The key to success with AI begins with FNOL. The First Notice of
          Loss is an insurer’s biggest opportunity to impress, thereby
          building trust and loyalty; or to disappoint, leading them to tell
          the world about their negative experience. FNOL is also an
          opportunity to capture rich structured information directly from
          the customer. This reduces downstream processing costs, supplies
          our AI more data to identify fraud early, and streamline
          downstream claims processing activity. Metromile’s DFNOL provides
          a streamlined, delightful experience that experience-conscious
          consumers demand. The result is happier customers, fewer phone
          calls, and a flood of rich data to help make your claims
          organization even more efficient.",

          body="You can't achieve AI success without rich, reliable data — which
          begins with the First Notice of Loss. This is also your biggest opportunity
          to make a positive impression on your customer, which is why we build
          AVA Dynamic FNOL. It offers a clean, delightful experience for your
          customers while providing a rich tapestry of data points for AVA Fraud
